# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

I think that, while the idea and concept of match functions was fairly easy to understand, applying it to actual code was kind of confusing, due to all the variables that could change the result of the function due to differences in each pattern.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

The match function could use specific keywords and terms to find a specific item in a list. For example, given a movie title and director, the match function could find the specific movie with more information within the larger movie database.
